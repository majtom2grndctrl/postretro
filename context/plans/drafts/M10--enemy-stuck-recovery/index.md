# M10 — Enemy Stuck Recovery (unwedge from concave geometry)

> **Wave:** M10 enemy-AI follow-up (refinement of the shipped `M10--enemy-ai-behavior` / `M10--pathfinding-path-following` foundation). Surfaced in manual play-testing: the enemy jams against a pillar when the player rounds it and stays immobile.
>
> **Adjacent specs:** `M10--enemy-steering-feel` (accel/turn-rate/arrival — different concern, same `agent_steering::tick` file) and `M10--enemy-locomotion-animation`. This spec is the **collision-recovery** gap; those are feel/animation.

## Goal

When a navigation agent's capsule wedges against concave world geometry (a pillar corner) and stops making progress despite having a valid route, detect the stall and recover — slide out and resume the chase — instead of staying frozen. Today there is **no stuck-detection anywhere in the steering loop**, so a wedged enemy is permanently and invisibly stuck.

## Background (the cause)

The wedge is a **collision-recovery gap**, not a routing failure:

- The brain re-aims the destination at the player's *raw* position every tick (`crates/postretro/src/scripting/systems/ai.rs:488-491`; the `SteeringIntent::Chase` arm; `set_destination(registry, outcome.id, player_pos)` is at 491), and `goal_velocity` re-issues full `move_speed` straight at the current waypoint each tick (`agent_steering.rs:440-472`).
- When the capsule contacts a concave corner, `collide_and_slide` projects the velocity to ~0 — two near-perpendicular wall normals consume it within the `SLIDE_ITERATIONS` budget (`agent/mod.rs:24`; 4 iterations; slide loop `agent/mod.rs:141-190`; `NORMAL_NUDGE` is only `1e-4`, `agent/mod.rs:42`). So the agent pushes into the corner and the harness correctly refuses to penetrate, yielding near-zero motion.
- Nothing in `tick` diffs the resolved position against the prior position — it writes `t.position = result.position` (`agent_steering.rs:366-370`) but never measures progress (`agent_steering.rs:228-375`). `AgentComponent` carries no `last_position` / `stuck_ticks` / progress field (`scripting/components/agent.rs:34-95`).
- Replans fire only on destination drift (`REPLAN_DEST_THRESHOLD` 0.5 m, `agent_steering.rs:67`) or staleness (~30 ticks), via `admit_replans` (`agent_steering.rs:395-432`). `blocked` stays **false** because the path is perfectly routable — the capsule simply can't physically traverse it. A fresh route still ends in a waypoint the wedged capsule must *move* to reach, so re-pathing alone does not unwedge it.
- Compounding: the navmesh erosion is coarse (Chebyshev/cell-quantized, `navmesh_bake.rs:399-441`; funnel string-pulls over portal segments, `nav/path.rs:244-309`), so a sub-cell sliver near pillar corners still lets the capsule make contact; and the separation pass can push neighbors *deeper* into a wedge in waves (`agent_steering.rs:481-523`).

## Scope

### In scope (Option A — the recommended, confined fix)

- **Stuck detection** in `agent_steering::tick`: track per-agent goal-projected progress (start-of-tick vs. resolved position, projected onto the goal/desired heading) and increment a `stuck_ticks` counter when progress is below an epsilon **while `!agent.path.is_empty() && !agent.blocked` and the agent intends to move** (i.e. goal/desired horizontal speed this tick is above the stuck epsilon — see gate below). Reset on real progress.
- **Recovery** on crossing a `stuck_ticks` threshold: (a) force a drift replan (clear the planned-destination latch so `admit_replans` recomputes a route), and (b) apply a **deterministic perpendicular tangent bias** to the desired velocity for a few ticks so the capsule slides along the obstacle out of the corner rather than grinding into it. No RNG.
- **Gating** so detection never fires for a legitimately stationary agent (idle / no path), a genuine no-route `blocked` state, or an arrived agent standing at the final waypoint with near-zero `goal_velocity` — recovery must not mask a real navigation failure. Only accrue `stuck_ticks` when `!agent.path.is_empty() && !agent.blocked` AND the goal/desired horizontal speed this tick is above the stuck epsilon (i.e. the agent intends to move; arrival/final-waypoint-reached where `goal_velocity` ≈ 0 is excluded).
- **Post-implementation escalation gate.** After Option A lands, run a manual check on `campaign-test` or an equivalent pillar/wedge fixture. If tangent recovery still leaves visible wall hugging, repeat wedge failures, or route-valid-but-physically-invalid corners, open a separate navmesh-clearance / capsule-exact bake-refinement draft. Do not implement that bake work here.

### Out of scope

- **Capsule-exact navmesh** (Option B): Euclidean radius erosion + funnel corner-offset so no waypoint sits within a radius of geometry. This touches the bake algorithm (bumps `NAVMESH_STAGE_VERSION`), region decomposition, and the funnel, and forces a re-bake of all maps. Deferred to a separate draft only if the post-implementation escalation gate fires.
- **Unstick inside `collide_and_slide`** (Option C, rejected): the sweep harness is intentionally intent-agnostic and cannot know which direction is "out," so recovery there would jitter. Recovery belongs in the steering tick, which owns intent.
- Player movement; inter-agent deadlock resolution beyond what the tangent slide + replan already give; flocking.
- Steering *feel* (accel/turn-rate/arrival) — `M10--enemy-steering-feel`.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **Detection latency (AC1a):** An agent commanded toward a target whose straight path wedges it in a concave (pillar-corner) collider — near-zero goal-projected progress while it holds a route, is not `blocked`, and has goal-speed above the stuck epsilon — accrues `stuck_ticks` to `STUCK_TICKS_THRESHOLD` (default: 20 ticks) and fires recovery (runnable unit test on the steering tick against a concave-corner collider; asserts the flag flips at threshold).
- [ ] **Escape latency (AC1b):** After recovery fires, net goal-projected displacement over the next `UNSTICK_WINDOW` ticks (default: 10 ticks) exceeds the stuck epsilon — the agent leaves the corner (runnable unit test on the same fixture; asserts stuck→escaped, not just that a flag flips).
- [ ] Recovery is deterministic under the fixed tick (identical inputs → identical escape path); the recovery slides along the goal-positive tangent — the perpendicular whose dot product with the direction-to-goal is positive. When the goal/desired heading is exactly (or near-exactly) radial into the corner, both perpendiculars have zero dot with the direction-to-goal and the goal-positive sign is undefined; the tie-break must be deterministic — use the right-hand perpendicular of the goal heading as the canonical choice in the zero/near-zero-dot case (asserted by reproducing the same recovery twice AND asserting the signed tangent matches the canonical perpendicular, not merely that it repeats).
- [ ] Stuck-detection does **not** fire for an agent that is legitimately stationary with no path (idle), nor for a genuine no-route `blocked` outcome, nor for an arrived agent standing at the final waypoint (where `goal_velocity` ≈ 0 and the intent gate is not satisfied) — gated on `!agent.path.is_empty() && !agent.blocked` AND goal-speed above the stuck epsilon (runnable unit tests for all three negative cases, including an arrived agent standing on the player).
- [ ] The change is confined to `agent_steering::tick` plus one `AgentComponent` progress field (`stuck_ticks: u32`); no navmesh re-bake, no `NAVMESH_STAGE_VERSION` bump, no wire/PRL/format change.
- [ ] Existing path-preservation, replan-budget, separation, and determinism tests from `M10--pathfinding-path-following` remain green; the forced replan routes through `admit_replans`' budget (does not bypass it), so replan-budget tests are not invalidated.
- [ ] Post-implementation manual check records whether tangent recovery resolves the wall-hugging/wedge fixture. If failures remain, the output is a new draft for navmesh clearance / capsule-exact bake refinement; this draft still ships no Option B code.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Progress field + stuck detection
Add a `stuck_ticks` field to `AgentComponent` (initialized in `AgentComponent::new`; `#[serde(default)]` for deserialization back-compat). In `tick`, compute start-vs-resolved goal-projected progress and update `stuck_ticks`, gated on `!agent.path.is_empty() && !agent.blocked` AND goal-speed above the stuck epsilon. Reset on progress. (Includes building the concave-corner test fixture — see Rough sketch.)

### Task 2: Tangent-slide recovery + forced replan
On threshold, clear the planned-destination latch (route the next `admit_replans`) and bias `desired` along the obstacle tangent (perpendicular to the goal/desired heading) for a short, fixed window so the capsule slides free. Compose with the `move_speed` clamp and separation. Consumes Task 1's detection.

## Sequencing

**Phase 1 (sequential):** Task 1 — establishes the detection signal and the component field.
**Phase 2 (sequential):** Task 2 — consumes Task 1's `stuck_ticks` in the same tick; shares `agent_steering.rs`.

## Rough sketch

- Field on `AgentComponent`: `stuck_ticks: u32` only — no `last_position`. Inside `tick`, both `position` (start-of-tick) and `result.position` (resolved) plus `desired` (goal heading) are already in scope, so progress is computable from in-tick locals; no persisted prior position is needed. Initialize in `AgentComponent::new` (agent.rs:104 — the single field-listing constructor; `from_nav_params`/`attach_agent` delegate to it). `#[serde(default)]` is only for back-compat deserialization, not spawn seeding (spawn goes through `new`).
- Detection: `progress = (resolved_xz - start_xz).dot(goal_dir_xz.normalize())` — displacement PROJECTED onto the goal/desired heading (net displacement toward the current waypoint), NOT raw XZ magnitude. Rationale: separation jitter adds raw XZ displacement without goal progress, which would reset `stuck_ticks` and mask a wedge in the multi-agent wave case. `if !agent.path.is_empty() && !agent.blocked && intends_to_move && progress < STUCK_PROGRESS_EPSILON { stuck_ticks += 1 } else { stuck_ticks = 0 }`. The force-replan latch is `agent.planned_destination = None` (setting it None makes `admit_replans`' drift test fire next tick). Epsilon sized well below a tick's expected goal-projected travel (`move_speed * dt`), generous enough to ignore separation jitter.
- Recovery at `stuck_ticks >= STUCK_TICKS_THRESHOLD`: set `agent.planned_destination = None` (routes through `admit_replans` budget — does not bypass it: `admit_replans` computes `drifted = planned_destination.is_none_or(|planned| distance > REPLAN_DEST_THRESHOLD)` (`agent_steering.rs:410-412`), so `None` makes `drifted` true and admits a drift replan next tick budget-permitting; budget-denied replan is acceptable because the tangent slide displaces the capsule so a later in-budget replan starts from a freed position; clearing the latch alone without the tangent slide is a near-no-op since the same start position re-routes the same wall-hugging path) and add a tangent component — rotate the goal/desired heading 90°, choosing the sign whose dot product with the direction-to-goal (toward the current waypoint/destination) is positive, i.e. the perpendicular side that makes progress toward the goal. This is deterministic from data already in `tick` (goal direction), needs no contact normal, and picks the productive side. Blend the tangent into `desired` for `UNSTICK_WINDOW` ticks, then re-clamp to `move_speed`. Guard zero-length headings (no NaN). Tie-break for zero/near-zero dot: when both perpendiculars score ≤ epsilon against the direction-to-goal (goal heading is radial into the corner), fall back to the right-hand perpendicular of the goal heading as the canonical choice — this is deterministic from data already in `tick` and preserves the "reproduce twice" guarantee.
- New module constants mirror the existing steering-constant style (`ARRIVAL_RADIUS_FACTOR`, `REPLAN_DEST_THRESHOLD`): defaults `STUCK_TICKS_THRESHOLD = 20`, `UNSTICK_WINDOW = 10`. These are tunable; the defaults make AC1a/AC1b runnable as pass/fail without manual threshold selection.
- **Test fixture requirement:** AC1a, AC1b, and AC3 require a concave-corner (pillar / interior-corner) trimesh fixture. The only existing steering test fixture is `LWall` (`agent_steering/tests.rs` ~55-141), a convex corner the agent successfully routes around — the opposite geometry and therefore unsuitable. The new fixture must be built the same single-source way as `LWall`: one wall description feeds BOTH the `CollisionWorld` trimesh AND a hand-built navmesh, with a navmesh route that stays valid through the wedge (so `agent.blocked` stays `false`). The fixture must be demonstrated to drive goal-projected progress to ~0 under the harness before stuck-detection is asserted; otherwise the test is vacuous.

## Open questions

- **Thresholds.** `STUCK_PROGRESS_EPSILON` — tune against a concave-corner test fixture. `STUCK_TICKS_THRESHOLD` (default 20) and `UNSTICK_WINDOW` (default 10) are pinned defaults; adjust only if play-testing reveals false positives or too-slow recovery. `REPLAN_STALENESS_TICKS` (`agent_steering.rs:42`, currently 30) is **not changed in this spec** — it is shared replan tuning outside the confined-fix scope, and the forced-replan latch already routes through `admit_replans`; shrinking the staleness window is a separate follow-up concern.
- **Tangent sign (RESOLVED).** Choose the perpendicular whose dot product with the direction-to-goal (toward the current waypoint/destination) is positive — the productive side. Deterministic from data already in `tick`; no contact normal needed.
- **Escalation threshold.** Option A is enough if wedged agents recover without visible wall hugging on `campaign-test` or the equivalent manual fixture. If route-valid wedge failures remain, create a separate navmesh-clearance / capsule-exact bake-refinement draft. Keep Option B out of this implementation pass.
