# Mod State Store

> Scripting-foundation spec. Prerequisite for **M13 Goal C** (UI decoupling seam). Grounding: `../M13--state-system/research.md` (esp. §9 code anchors, §11 design decisions).

## Goal

A general, engine-global typed **state store**: mods declare named state at mod-init, the engine owns some of it (readonly), and game logic reads and writes it. Establishes the slot table, the declaration primitive, typed slots with validation and persistence, the engine-owned/modder-declared ownership split, the read/write API, and the branded `StateValue<T>` contract. The substrate that the UI decoupling seam (M13 Goal C) consumes and that game-logic global state builds on. **No UI** — no rendering, binding, diffing, or the once-per-frame read snapshot.

This exists as its own spec because the store is not UI-only: game logic owns values the HUD merely displays (score, objective progress, a mod's custom resource). A store both game logic and UI consume belongs below the UI milestone.

## Scope

### In scope

- **Slot table.** Engine-global registry of typed slots keyed by dotted name (`player.health`, `audio.master`). Survives level loads (never cleared), `DataRegistry` precedent. Lives on `ScriptCtx`.
- **Slot value model.** A tagged value enum — number, boolean, string, enum, array (flat; no nested objects, per `ui-layer.md` §9). Per-slot schema: type, default, optional range, `persist`, `readonly`, plus the current value.
- **`defineState` declaration primitive.** Mod-level (`setupMod`, `DefinitionOnly` scope — the first real consumer of that scope). Installs in both runtimes; the schema crosses the JS/Luau bridge (`conv.rs`) → serde; Rust-side validation (finite/range — serde can't bound numbers). Returns branded handles.
- **Ownership.** The engine registers its own readonly namespaces (e.g. `player.*`) at init through the *same* table API. `readonly: true` blocks *script* writes; engine writes bypass it. Modders declare their own writable namespaces.
- **Read/write API.** Behavior-context primitives so game-logic scripts read a slot's current value and write non-readonly slots (clamped/validated on write), mirroring the `world.getGravity()` / `world.setGravity()` precedent. Engine-side read/write for engine-owned slots.
- **Branded `StateValue<T>`.** The generated TS/Luau typedefs express `StateValue<T>` as a *generic* branded type (the brand emitter is non-generic today — this closes that gap).
- **Persisted-slot save wire format.** A versioned flat JSON file for `persist: true` slots: load-on-start (persisted values override declared defaults, type-checked), save-on-shutdown.
- **Tests.** Both-runtime declaration parity, validation/clamp, readonly rejection, persistence round-trip, slot-table survives level load.

### Out of scope

- **UI consumption** — the once-per-frame published read snapshot, descriptor binding, value diffing, relayout, rendering, the static proxy. → **M13 Goal C** (consumes this store).
- **Component-local state** — `liveValue()`, per-component ephemeral cells. → **G1** (needs the SDK component model + lifecycle to scope to).
- **UI-reaction `setState`** — writing a slot from a UI event/reaction as serializable IR. → **E / F**. This spec's read/write is direct behavior-context primitives, not UI reactions.
- **SDK ergonomic wrappers** — typed namespaced handle objects, `audio.master.get()/.set()` sugar, JSX. → **G1**. This spec ships the primitive + brand type; the typed SDK lib is G1.
- **Derived/computed values, value tweening, structured/nested values, arrays-of-objects.** Flat scalar/array surface only.
- **Per-user save directory** (`dirs`-style dependency) — a single working-directory-relative path for now.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `defineState(namespace, schema)` declares a slot namespace from **both** runtimes with parity (TS and Luau equivalents produce the same slots); the table holds them after mod init; a malformed schema or unknown slot type returns an error (not a panic).
- [ ] A `number` slot declared with `range: [min, max]` clamps an out-of-range write to the range and logs a warning; the clamped value is stored.
- [ ] The engine registers `player.health` / `player.ammo` as `readonly` engine-owned slots at init; a behavior-context script write to a readonly slot is rejected and logged; an engine-side write to the same slot succeeds.
- [ ] A behavior-context script reads a slot's current value and writes a non-readonly slot; the write is validated/clamped.
- [ ] The generated TS and Luau typedefs express `StateValue<T>` as a generic branded type.
- [ ] A `persist: true` slot round-trips: a write, a save, and a restart restore the value over the declared default; a non-persist slot does not serialize; a persisted entry with an unknown name or mismatched type is ignored with a warning.
- [ ] The slot table survives a level load (declared slots and their values persist across a map transition).

## Tasks

### Task 1: Slot table + value model
Add the slot table as a `ScriptCtx` field (`Rc<RefCell<…>>`, mirroring `data_registry` — engine-global, never cleared across level loads). Define the tagged slot-value enum (number/bool/string/enum/array) and the per-slot record (schema: type, default, range, `persist`, `readonly`; current value). Pure data; the substrate every later task uses.

### Task 2: `defineState` + schema + validation + engine-owned registration
Add a `scripting/primitives/state.rs` domain module exporting `register_state_primitives(registry, ctx)`, called from `register_all` (`primitives/mod.rs`); register `defineState` with `.scope(ContextScope::DefinitionOnly)`. The primitive receives the schema as a VM value, crosses via `js_to_json` / `lua_to_json` → `serde_json::from_value` into the schema struct, validates (finite/range, Rust-side — `LightDescriptor::validate` precedent), and inserts slots. Add the engine-side registration call for `player.*` (readonly, engine-owned) at init through the same insert path. Both runtimes; parity test.

### Task 3: Read/write API
Behavior-context primitives to read a slot's current value and write a non-readonly slot (clamp/validate on write; reject writes to readonly with a warn). Mirror `world.getGravity` / `world.setGravity` (`world.rs`) — closures capture a `ScriptCtx` clone and go through the `RefCell`. Engine-side read/write accessor for engine-owned slots (used by Goal C's proxy and, later, real game logic). The exact ergonomic spelling (handle methods vs. a `state` namespace vs. free functions) is the open question below — the capability is fixed.

### Task 4: Branded `StateValue<T>` generic typedef
Extend the typedef generator so `StateValue<T>` emits generically: `export type StateValue<T> = T & { readonly __brand: "StateValue" }` in TS and the Luau alias. `TypeShape::Brand` (`primitives_registry.rs`) + the emitter (`typedef.rs`) are non-generic today — add the generic parameter. Independent of Task 3.

### Task 5: Persisted-slot save wire format
Define and implement the `persist: true` save format (see *Save wire format*). Load-on-start applies persisted values over declared defaults *after* declaration, type-checked (mismatched/unknown ignored with a warn). Save-on-shutdown serializes only `persist: true` slots. Exercised via the read/write API. Independent of Tasks 3–4.

## Sequencing

**Phase 1 (sequential):** Task 1 — slot table + value model. Blocks all.
**Phase 2 (sequential):** Task 2 — `defineState` + validation + engine registration. Consumes Task 1.
**Phase 3 (concurrent):** Task 3 (read/write API), Task 4 (brand typedef), Task 5 (persistence) — each consumes Task 1/2, independent of one another.

## Rough sketch

**Slot table.** A new `ScriptCtx` field, `Rc<RefCell<SlotTable>>`, mirroring `data_registry: Rc<RefCell<DataRegistry>>` (`ctx.rs`) — populated in the definition context, never cleared. Slot value is a small tagged enum (`Number(f32) | Bool(bool) | Str(String) | Enum(u32/interned) | Array(Vec<f32>)`) for cheap clamping and (Goal C's) diffing. Each entry stores the schema + current value. (Goal C adds a previous-frame snapshot for diffing — not here.)

**`defineState` ingestion.** Mirror `world.rs` `register_world_gravity`: the closure captures a `ScriptCtx` clone, writes through the `RefCell`. Schema VM value → `js_to_json` / `lua_to_json` → `serde_json::from_value` → validate → insert. Engine-owned `player.*` uses the same insert path with `readonly` + engine-owned markers. The `readonly` check rejects *script* writes (Task 3); engine writes bypass it.

**Brand generic.** `TypeShape::Brand { underlying }` emits `T & { __brand }` non-generically (`typedef.rs`). Extend with an optional generic parameter (or a dedicated generic-brand shape) so `StateValue<T>` emits generically. Representation is the implementer's call within the "emits generically" constraint.

**Key files.** `scripting/ctx.rs` (slot-table field), new `scripting/primitives/state.rs` (`defineState`, read/write), `scripting/primitives/mod.rs` (`register_all` wiring), `scripting/conv.rs` (bridge — reuse), `scripting/data_descriptors.rs` (validate precedent), `scripting/primitives_registry.rs` + `scripting/typedef.rs` (generic brand), new persistence module. Governing doc for wire/casing: `scripting.md`.

## Boundary inventory

The `defineState` schema crosses Rust ↔ wire (JSON) ↔ JS/TS ↔ Luau. No FGD surface. Rust fields snake_case; wire/JS/Luau camelCase.

| Name | Rust | Wire / serde | JS / TS | Luau |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| primitive | `defineState` (registered fn) | n/a (call) | `defineState` | `defineState` |
| namespace | `String` arg | first positional string | `"audio"` | `"audio"` |
| slot type tag | enum by `type` | `type`: `"number"`/`"boolean"`/`"string"`/`"enum"`/`"array"` | same literals | same literals |
| default | `default` | `default` | `default` | `default` |
| range | `Option<[f32; 2]>` | `range` (`[min,max]`) | `range` | `range` |
| persist flag | `persist: bool` | `persist` | `persist` | `persist` |
| readonly flag | `readonly: bool` | `readonly` | `readonly` | `readonly` |
| enum values | `values: Vec<String>` | `values` | `values` | `values` |
| slot name (ref) | `String` | dotted, `"player.health"` | `"player.health"` | `"player.health"` |
| branded handle type | n/a (typedef only) | n/a | `StateValue<T>` | `StateValue<T>` |

## Save wire format

A new JSON (not PRL/binary) surface for `persist: true` slots:

- **File:** single working-directory-relative path (e.g. `state.json`). Per-user directory resolution deferred (non-goal).
- **Shape:** `{ "version": <u32>, "slots": { "<dotted.name>": <value>, … } }`. Flat map; values match the slot's declared type (number → JSON number, boolean → bool, string/enum → string, array → JSON array of numbers).
- **Versioning:** integer `version`; an unrecognized version is ignored with a warn (defaults stand).
- **Empty:** no persist slots → `"slots": {}`. Missing file → all defaults, not an error.
- **Restore order:** declare first (defaults applied), then overlay persisted values. Unknown name or type mismatch → ignore + warn, never panic. Serializer: `serde_json`.

## Open questions

- **Declaration verb name.** Working name `defineState` (matches `ui-layer.md` §9 + roadmap). Owner is reconsidering the "state" family (research §11.3): the live-family alternative is `liveState()` (parallel to the component-local `liveValue()` that lands in G1). The **type** `StateValue<T>` stays regardless. Decide before promotion.
- **Read/write ergonomic shape.** Handle methods (`handle.get()/.set(v)`), a `state` namespace primitive (`state.get(name)/.set(name, v)`), or free functions — pick one. Avoid the bare name `setState` (collides with the deferred UI-reaction `setState`, E/F, and React). The richer typed namespaced sugar is G1; this spec ships the minimal capability.
- **Engine-owned registration path.** Recommended: engine registers `player.*` through the same insert API with an engine-owned/readonly marker (one code path). Confirm vs. a dedicated engine-only path.
- **Generic-brand representation.** Extend `TypeShape::Brand` vs. a new generic-brand shape vs. hand-authored in the SDK lib. Implementer's call within the "emits generically" constraint.
