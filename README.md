Postretro is a Quake-style FPS engine in Rust that looks and feels “like they used to make,” but embellishes the past with updated, lean technologies under the hood that enable game builders to **bring more boom to the boomer shooter.**

The visual target is something like Prodeus — chunky pixels, baked lighting, specular maps, cyberpunk atmosphere. But the goal is to earn that look through low-cost rendering techniques, resulting in _a game that **feels like** you remember_ but _**looks better** than the real thing._

It's early days, but the foundation is coming together fast. Right now Postretro compiles TrenchBroom maps into a custom binary format, renders fully textured levels, and drives the whole thing through a GPU-culled rendering pipeline: per-frame portal traversal narrows the visible set, a global BVH handles frustum culling on the GPU, and geometry is dispatched via indirect draw calls with zero per-object CPU overhead. Everything after that — lighting, movement, enemies, the whole game — is still ahead of us. That's kind of the fun part.

## Context Architecture (Like Project Docs for Agents)

**The real reason I’ve open sourced this project**

Most projects end up with documentation that quietly lies — a design doc describing a function renamed two months ago, an architecture guide pointing at a module that got split in half. The more specific a document is about code, the faster it rots. That's not a discipline problem you can fix by trying harder; it's structural. The code is where truth lives, and copies of the truth go stale.

So Postretro splits its docs into two layers with very different expectations:

- **Durable knowledge** (`context/lib/`) — the things that stay true even when code shifts underneath them: design principles, subsystem boundaries, data contracts, frame ordering, the reasoning behind the architecture. A renderer rewrite shouldn't invalidate "all wgpu calls live in the renderer module." These docs rarely need maintenance, which is exactly why they're worth maintaining.
- **Ephemeral artifacts** (`context/plans/`) — the working notes of active development: specs, task breakdowns, function names, algorithm choices. Essential while a feature is being built, disposable once it ships. Plans move `drafts/` → `ready/` → `in-progress/` → `done/`, and old ones get pruned.

The litmus test: *if we rewrote this module differently, would the sentence still be true?* Yes → durable. No → it's a plan, or better, a code comment next to the thing it describes.

This matters more for an AI-assisted project than a traditional one. Every agent session starts cold and loads context from scratch. Feed it stale detail and it gives confident answers about a codebase that no longer exists. Feed it a compact, durable picture of how the system is *meant* to fit together, and it can read the live code for the specifics. Agents start from `context/lib/index.md`, which routes them to the minimum docs they need.

### Context Folder Structure

```
context/
  lib/                  # Durable architectural knowledge (the "context library")
    index.md            # "Agent router" — directs agents to files relevant to their current task
    [topic].md          # Durable architectural knowledge about a specific topic

  plans/                # Work tracking (ephemeral by design)
    drafts/             # Specs being written, not yet reviewed
    ready/              # Reviewed specs, queued for implementation
    in-progress/        # Actively being worked on
    done/               # Recently completed (max 15, older plans pruned)
```

```

#### 1. Plan

A new feature starts as a spec in `context/plans/drafts/`. The spec defines acceptance criteria, task sequencing, and which context library files need updates.

#### 2. Finalize (drafts/ → ready/)

At the end of drafting, durable architectural decisions get written into `context/lib/` — new subsystem boundaries, contracts, pipeline topology, design principles. This happens before the plan moves to `ready/`, so accurate context is in place before any code is written. Once reviewed and approved, the plan moves to `ready/`, the backlog of work queued for execution.

#### 3. Execute (ready/ → in-progress/)

Implementation proceeds according to the plan's sequencing (serial or parallel phases), referencing `context/lib/` for architectural guidance. Code comments capturing implementation-level "why" decisions are written during development, not as a separate step.

#### 4. Review and Verify

Implementation is checked against acceptance criteria, architectural constraints, and coding conventions. A quality gate runs fmt, clippy, and tests.

#### 5. Distill (in-progress/ → done/)

Revise `context/lib/` to address any context drift that emerged during execution — assumptions that proved wrong, boundaries that shifted, contracts that evolved. Once the context library is up to date, move the completed plan to `done/`. The `done/` folder keeps recently completed plans accessible for reference; old plans are periodically pruned to keep no more than 15.

**The guiding principle:** context files describe what survives refactoring. If a sentence would break when a module is reorganized or a function is renamed, it belongs in a task spec or code comment — not in `context/lib/`.

### Skills (.claude/skills/)

The lifecycle is supported by Claude Code skills:

| Skill | Role |
|-------|------|
| `plan` | Creates feature specs with task breakdown, sequencing, and acceptance criteria |
| `orchestrate` | Coordinates plan execution — spawns agents, tracks progress, moves plans through stages |
| `code-review` | Reviews implementations against specs, architecture, and conventions |
| `review-panel` | Spawns 3 reviewer agents that approach review from different angles |
| `preflight` | Pre-commit quality gate: fmt, clippy, test |
| `create-skill` | Builds new skills for the project |

## Planned Milestones

The engine is being built in phases, each of which produces something you can actually see and test. Here's the rough shape of the road ahead:

- **Milestone 1** ✅ — BSP loading and wireframe rendering, PVS culling, free-fly camera
- **Milestone 1.5** ✅ — Custom PRL level compiler: .map → .prl with voxel-based visibility, portal geometry, and exterior void sealing
- **Milestone 2** ✅ — Fixed-timestep game loop, action-mapped input (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
- **Milestone 3** ✅ — Textured world with solid rendering, depth buffer, material system
- **Milestone 3.5** ✅ — Rendering foundation: vertex format upgrade (packed normals and tangents), GPU-driven indirect draw dispatch. Same visuals as Milestone 3, new architecture underneath.
- **Milestone 4** ✅ — BVH foundation: global SAH BVH over all static geometry, GPU compute frustum culling via skip-index DFS traversal, fixed-slot indirect buffer. Per-cell chunking from Milestone 3.5 retired in favor of the global BVH.
- **Milestone 5** — Lighting foundation: SH irradiance volume (baked indirect), clustered forward+ dynamic lights, normal maps, shadow maps
- **Milestone 6** — Embedded scripting and entity foundation: scripted entity model, FGD entity parsing, hot reload, modder-facing API
- **Milestone 7** — Player movement: collision, gravity, step-up, jump — engine floor exposed as a script API so modders can craft their own feel
- **Milestone 8** — Weapons as scripted entities: hitscan, projectiles, pickups, viewmodel hooks
- **Milestone 9** — NPC entities: scripted AI with engine-provided navigation and line-of-sight primitives
- **Milestone 10** — World entities: doors, triggers, brush movers, scripted set pieces
- **Future** — Visual polish (sprites, emissives, fog), post-processing (bloom, CRT filter, cubemap reflections), audio, HUD, and whatever else a boomer shooter needs

The full phased plan with acceptance criteria lives in `context/plans/roadmap.md`.

cargo run -p postretro -- assets/maps/test.prl                 # load a PRL map
cargo run -p postretro-level-compiler -- input.map -o out.prl  # compile a level

RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p postretro                           # with logging
```

## Architecture

Five architectural invariants govern the engine:

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Renderer owns GPU | All wgpu calls live in the renderer module. Other subsystems never touch wgpu types. |
| Baked over computed | Indirect lighting baked offline (SH irradiance volume). Direct illumination is fully dynamic (clustered forward+ with shadow maps). |
| Subsystem boundaries | Renderer, audio, input, game logic are distinct modules with explicit contracts. |
| Frame ordering | Input → Game logic → Audio → Render → Present. |
| No `unsafe` | If `unsafe` appears necessary, stop and consult the project owner. |

## Non-Goals

- General-purpose game engine
- ECS architecture
- Deferred rendering
- Runtime level compilation
- Multiplayer / networking
